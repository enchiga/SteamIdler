**F.A.Q

- Why is SteamIdler.zip marked as a virus by windows?
*The reason this file is marked as a virus is because in order to idle properly the software has to edit files in the Steam game directory, Windows is detecting this as a virus for this reason and can simply be avoided by either turning off your windows defender or adding it to the windows defender file blacklist*

- How does it work?
*SteamIdler will search for the game application in the file you select, it will then modify the files to simply open up a command prompt. Doing this still triggers Steam to believe you are playing the game.*

- How can I hide it
*You can hide it by making a new virtual desktop and simply dragging the command prompt to that new desktop*

- Is it bannable?
*No, for many years people have used playtime idlers, many people claim to have been banned for using them but these only seem to apply to VAC secure games, to be safe use on VAC Steam games with caution (SteamIdler is not liable for any damages to intellectual property such as: banned steam accounts, game files not working, etc)*

- I have a bug where can I report it
*We have a Feedback and Bug report form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSey0koX4e_xk_T4cxYwcj8LZw9w4Kio9JOhVYqBWT3f7dO5yQ/viewform*

- Do I need to sign into Steam?
*Nope, simply click the game file you want to idle and let it do the magic, no sign in required as it manipulates files on your operating system*
